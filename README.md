## Hello fellow geeksters! 👋

My name is Dominik Dekleva. 

I'm a biochemist with a Cancer Research background - spent many many hours on a fluorescent microscope staining cancer cells which I was trying to kill in different ways. 

After academia I joined an early-stage startup Better Origin based in Cambridge, UK where we used insects to recycle food waste with an AI/ML twist. We came up with our first product X1 which is a shipping container turned into an AI-run mini insect farm. These modules can be places on farms, food processing hubs and are a plug-and-play option to recycle food waste, which enters the module on one side, and Black Soldier Fly larvae fed on that waste are harvested out the other. These can then be directly fed to many different animals like chickens, fish, pigs or processed into diferent high-value streams like proteins, fats, chitin etc. In that role I first came into contact with AI/ML which fascinated me to the point where I spent all my evenings learning all I could about it, and after a while decided to engage the obsession full-time. 

Currently geeking out on Data Science and all things AI/ML at [@AiCore](https://github.com/AI-Core).

I'm also a guitarist and electronic music producer when I have excess creative juices flowing. You can find me around jamming as Prince Officer.

## ⚡Personal one liner:
Hard working, hyper curious natural-born problem solver who thrives under pressure and enjoys nature, good food, music, coding and books (very proud of my 📚 collection).
