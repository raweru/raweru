### Hello fellow geeksters! ğŸ‘‹

My name is Dominik Dekleva. 

I'm a biochemist with a Cancer Research background - spent many many hours on a fluorescent microscope staining cancer cells which I was trying to kill in different ways. 

After academia I joined an early-stage startup Better Origin based in Cambridge, UK where we used insects to recycle food waste with an AI/ML twist. We came up with our first product X1 which was a shipping container turned into an AI-run mini insect farm. These modules can be places on farms, food processing hubs etc. and are a plug and play option to recycle food waste, which enters the module on one side, and Black Soldier Fly larvae fed on that waste are harvested out the other. In that role I first came into contact with AI/ML which fascinated me to the point where I spent all my evenings learning all I could about it, and after a while decided to engage the obsession full-time. 

I also produce electronic music when I have excess creative juices flowing. You can find me around as Prince Officer
