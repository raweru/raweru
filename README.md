## Hello fellow geeksters! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dominik Dekleva. 

I'm a biochemist with a Cancer Research background.

After academia, I joined an early-stage startup Better Origin based in Cambridge, UK where we used insects to recycle food waste with an AI/ML twist. We came up with our first product X1 which is a shipping container turned into an AI-run mini insect farm. These modules can be placed on farms, food processing hubs and are a plug-and-play option to recycle food waste, which enters the module on one side, and Black Soldier Fly larvae fed on that waste are harvested out the other. These can then be directly fed to many different animals like chickens, fish, pigs or processed into different high-value streams like proteins, fats, chitin etc. In that role I first came into contact with AI/ML which fascinated me to the point where I spent all my evenings learning all I could about it, and after a while decided to engage the obsession full-time.


Currently working on my Ph.D. developing ML methods to improve Molecular Dynamics Simulations for use in Drug Design.


I'm also a guitarist and electronic music producer. You can find me around jamming as Prince Officer.


## âš¡Personal one-liner:
Hard-working, hyper-curious natural-born problem solver who thrives under pressure and enjoys nature, good food, music, coding, and books (very proud of my ðŸ“š collection).
